# Computer-Science-for-Business-Analytics
This repository contains the algorithm accompanying the paper for Computer Science for Business Analytics '22-'23

The code given in this repository is a duplicate detection algorithm written in Python. Also included are functions used for bootstrapping results presented in the paper. A description of each function is given below.

**Cleandata**
Within this function, the data set in data.frame format is used as input. The model words are extracted from the title and is returned as a vector. Model ID's are extracted and used for performance evaluation. The data is standardized and cleaned and pre-selection vectors are returned: shop, brand, resolution.
